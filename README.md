# Front End Assignment 1 - Javascript Fundamentals

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to provide hands on experience with javascript, html and css fundamentals by creating a simple web page/application without using any external javascript frameworks or libraries. The web page consists of a simple work/banking system for attaining money, interacting with a bank for depositing this money, as well as taking out a loan to increase bank funds. The money can be used to purchase computers by interacting with a tiny computer store component populated with computer-objects fetched from an external API.

- src/functions.js
  Contains all of the JavaScript functionality used in the application
- public/app.css
  Contains all of the styling used in the application
